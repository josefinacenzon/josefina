#### ABSTRACT

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Households' mortgage choice in the eurozone shows considerable heterogeneity, both across and within country. The persistence of different preferences when choosing between an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) versus a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) two decades after introducing a com- mon currency is a puzzle. We argue that these patterns can be explained by the long-lasting effect of personal experiences of high-inflation periods prior to joining the eurozone. Using representative microdata of 9 countries from the Eurosystem’s Household Finance and Consumption Survey, we show that past exposure to higher inflation predicts significantly lower probability of holding an FRM. The sign of the result is the opposite of what have recently been found in the US. We link our results to the theoretical literature on households’ risk management in mortgage financing decisions and argue that prepayment penalties in the eurozone increase the inflation risk (i.e. the uncertainty of real payments) of an FRM. In line with this, we provide evidence that personal inflation experiences affect risk attitudes: households that experienced high and volatile inflation report lower willingness to take financial risk.
