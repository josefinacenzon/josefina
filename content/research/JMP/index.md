#### ABSTRACT

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Personal experiences can significantly shape expectations. Contrary to the prevailing belief that these effects are domain-specific, my analysis of US household survey data reveals a broader impact: individuals experiencing credit rejections become more pessimistic about various economic indicators, including US-level unemployment, credit markets, stock prices, and inflation. To explain these findings, I propose a model of selective and associative memory where expectations are formed through the recall of past experiences and simulation of future events. This model explains the documented pessimism and yields novel predictions with important economic implications. Using a consumption-saving model, I show that memories of credit rejections can have an amplifying effect on economic behaviour. Empirical evidence indicates that 12% of the negative impact on durable consumption results solely from this pessimism. This amplifying effect varies among individuals and intensifies during economic downturns, leading to over-reaction and reduced aggregate demand. These findings underscore the significant role of highly idiosyncratic experiences in shaping behaviour and their potential impact on the economy.
