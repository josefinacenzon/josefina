<!-- ##### Short summary -->

#### ABSTRACT

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Using data from US household surveys, I find that when people personally experience credit rejections, they become pessimistic not only about their own financial future but also about broader economic conditions like  US-level unemployment, credit markets, stock prices, and inflation. This pessimism is unrelated to the informativeness of the experience, common aggregate shocks, or specific loan-applicant characteristics. To shed light on these findings, I propose a model that links the observed experience-effects to memories of those experiences. In line with its predictions, (1) less sophisticated individuals rely more on their own experiences, and (2) the impact of personal experiences on beliefs is state-dependent, with own rejections having a stronger pessimism effect during low macroeconomic states. This memory-based process has significant economic consequences. Using a consumption-saving model, I show that rejections have both direct and indirect effects on behavior due to an excessive reliance on personal memories. Empirical evidence indicates that 15% of the negative impact of rejections on durable consumption is solely due to the macro pessimism caused by those rejections. These findings underscore the significant role of highly personal and idiosyncratic experiences in shaping individuals' behavior and their potential impact on the overall economy.
