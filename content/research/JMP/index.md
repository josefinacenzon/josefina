<!-- ##### Short summary -->

#### ABSTRACT

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Using the NY Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, I show that people experiencing credit rejections are too pessimistic about US credit markets, inflation, unemployment, and stock prices. This finding not only challenges standard experience effects, which are assumed to be domain specific, but has important economic implications. Using an associative memory model of belief formation and data, I show theoretically and empirically that reliance on personal past rejections create: i) systematic belief heterogeneity across groups, and ii) overreaction of beliefs during recessions. Incorporating these findings into a consumption-saving model, I show that memories of credit rejections amplify economic behaviour. Data on planned durable consumption reveals that 12% of the total negative impact of rejections results solely from the pessimism bias. This amplification effect is particularly pronounced among younger individuals, and during economic downturns, leading to amplified contractions in aggregate demand through beliefs. These findings underscore the significant role of idiosyncratic experiences in shaping behaviour and their potential impact on the economy.
