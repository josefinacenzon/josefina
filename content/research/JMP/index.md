#### ABSTRACT

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Using data from US household surveys I find that when people personally experience credit rejections they become pessimistic not only about their own financial future but also about broader economic conditions like  US-level unemployment, credit markets, stock prices, and inflation. I show that this pessimism is unrelated to the informativeness of the experience, common aggregate shocks, or specific loan-applicant characteristics. To shed light on these findings, I propose a model of selective memory in which people form expectations by recalling information and past experiences, which are then used to simulate the event being forecasted. The model leads to predictable disagreement and state-dependency of beliefs, predictions that are confirmed in the data: less sophisticated and younger individuals rely more on their own experiences, and the impact of personal rejections on beliefs is stronger when current economic conditions are low. This memory-based process has significant economic consequences. Using a consumption-saving model, I show that rejections have both direct and indirect effects on behaviour due to an excessive reliance on personal memories. Empirical evidence indicates that $15\%$ of the negative impact of rejections on durable consumption is solely due to the pessimism caused by those rejections. These findings underscore the significant role of highly personal and idiosyncratic experiences in shaping individuals' behaviour and their potential impact on the overall economy, as credit crunches can get strongly amplified through beliefs.
