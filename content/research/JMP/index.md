<!-- ##### Short summary -->

#### ABSTRACT

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Using the NY Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, I show that individuals give excessive weight to their personal credit rejections when forecasting U.S. credit markets, unemployment, and inflation. This evidence challenges standard belief-formation theories. I explain it through an associative memory model in which a rejection cues memories of bad aggregate conditions and experiences, thereby inflating pessimism about the macroeconomy. The data support three main predictions: (i) rejected individuals recall tighter credit conditions and project them onto more pessimistic forecasts, (ii) this forecast heterogeneity correlates with demographics, and (iii) during adverse shocks, there is not only disagreement but also aggregate overreaction. Incorporating these findings into a consumption-saving model and using data on planned durable consumption, I find that rejection-induced pessimism accounts for about 12% of the total negative impact on consumption --particularly for younger and lower-SES households, and in downturns-- leading to amplified contractions in aggregate demand.
